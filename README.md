The brick-breaker game allows a human to control a paddle that can only move horizontally at the bottom of the screen. 
This paddle is used to bounce a ball that moves around the level. If the ball hits a brick, the brick is destroyed. 
The objective is to destroy all the destructible bricks in the level.

The difficulty of the game lies in catching the ball with the paddle to guide it towards the remaining bricks in the level. 
A ball can bounce off the side walls and the top edge of the map. It also bounces off the bricks. However, if the ball goes 
past the paddle's rebound area, the ball is destroyed. The game is lost when there are no more balls on the screen.
